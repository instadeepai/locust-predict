- Pseudo-absence

> Even though the database does have some absence records, we did not use them for being very unbalanced in comparison with presences. In addition to that, those records can be also considered as "pseudoabsences" owing to hoppers in solitarious phase may go unnoticed at low densities.26 Thus, we found it convenient to randomly generate a grid of "pseudoabsences" as reported in other studies using SDMs.6

> Pseudoabsence samples were computed based on two principles. First, they were located within a maximum of 50-km radius mask created of ever desert locust presence (1985 to 2015), aiming to select areas with environmental and geophysical potentialities and to reduce geographical bias. We chose this distance for matching visually with the density map (Fig. 1), where most of the areas with no presences are masked out. Otherwise, it could misguide SDM predictions.

> We accessed 9,134 desert locust occurrence records and applied a machine-learning algorithm to predict potential desert locust breeding sites in East Africa using key bio-climatic (temperature and rainfall) and edaphic (sand and moisture contents) factors.

> In particular, within a few weeks, swarming adults mature, mate, and begin to oviposit in soils at 10–15 cm below ground in suitable environments in the invaded zones2,11. Suitability for oviposition and subsequent breeding is influenced by factors such as soil type, sand content, soil moisture, surface air temperature, rainfall, and prevalence of vegetation

> Surface temperature emerged as a critical factor, followed by soil moisture and sand content.

> type of vegetation is critical for desert locust oviposition and breeding
